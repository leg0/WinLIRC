This is a simple Winamp plugin that allows you to use WinLIRC to control
some of the basic Winamp functions.  To use it, put the gen_ir.dll file
in your Winamp plugin directory (usually "c:\program files\winamp\plugins").
Then, load Winamp, go to Preferences, Misc Plugins, select the WinLIRC
plugin, and hit Configure to set it up.

Note: When adding a button, the "button id" is the textual name that
you gave the button in the WinLIRC configuration file.
